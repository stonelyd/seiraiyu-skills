screenctl - deterministic screen-control primitives for a coding agent, on any OS.

One file, no third-party packages. Each backend uses what the operating system
already ships: Windows drives user32 through ctypes and shells to PowerShell only
to PNG-encode a capture; macOS uses osascript, screencapture, pbcopy and sips;
Linux/X11 uses xdotool, xclip and maim or ImageMagick.

The one design rule, and the reason this is a checked-in script rather than shell
improvised per run: EVERY action that sends input re-verifies the foreground window
first, and exits non-zero instead of sending. Keystrokes go wherever focus is. An
unverified send during stolen focus types into the wrong application, and by the
time anyone can see that happened, it already has.

  screenctl.py doctor                       # run this FIRST on a new machine
  screenctl.py list
  screenctl.py find   --title "myrepo - Visual Studio Code"
  screenctl.py focus  --title "..."
  screenctl.py shot   --title "..." --out /tmp/a.png
  screenctl.py type   --title "..." --text "claude"
  screenctl.py paste  --title "..." (--file f | --text t)
  screenctl.py key    --title "..." --keys enter
  screenctl.py click  --title "..." --x 850 --y 730 [--double|--right]
  screenctl.py scroll --title "..." --amount -3

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 refused (not found / ambiguous / focus unconfirmed / bad input).

Every run appends one line per action to ~/.screenctl/actions.log, so a run that
went wrong is inspectable afterwards instead of being reconstructed from memory.
